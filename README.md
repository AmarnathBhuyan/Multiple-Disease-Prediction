This project focuses on the development and implementation of an ML-based system for the detection of multiple diseases, specifically targeting heart diseases,
diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and lung diseases. By leveraging a diverse set of medical datasets, including imaging and clinical records, the system employs
cutting-edge algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). These algorithms are adept at recognizing
complex patterns and biomarkers that are indicative of various diseases, thereby facilitating early and reliable diagnosis. The objective of this project is to 
create an accessible, efficient, and scalable solution that can support healthcare professionals in making timely, informed decisions. By integrating ML into the 
diagnostic process, we aim to enhance the accuracy of disease detection, reduce diagnostic errors, and ultimately contribute to the improvement of healthcare delivery.
